\section*{Introduction and Description of the Work}

I will be writing a dissertation. It will be in a subject area that interests me, and with a sufficiently outlined idea.

\section*{Starting Point}

People have worked on this area of thing before. Otherwise I wouldn't be doing a dissertation on it.

\section*{Substance and Structure of the Project}

The dissertation will have some work in it.

\section*{Success Criteria}

The project will be considered a success if it works.

\section{Resources Declaration}

I'll obviously be using my personal computer because the MCS machines are shit.

I'll push it up to GitLab because it's better than GitHub (fite me), and still works as a backup solution. I might even upload it to the University OneDrive and MCS filestores once a week or something to make sure it doesn't disappear.

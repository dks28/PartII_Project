  description = {This monograph is an intertwined tale of eigenvalues and their use in unlocking a thousand secrets about graphs. The stories will be told --- how the spectrum reveals fundamental properties of a graph, how spectral graph theory links the discrete universe to the continuous one through geometric, analytic and algebraic techniques, and how, through eigenvalues, theory and applications in communications and computer science come together in symbiotic harmony....},
